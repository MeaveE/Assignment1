# Assignment1
Assignment for OOP

This is a space ship simulation which contains four control buttons and one central control prizm and 
sliders and radars. 

If you slide your mouse over the prizm the vertex will join to your mouse 
If you slide your mouse left and right of the screen the ship will speed faster through
space.
If you glide your mouse over the slider in the bottom left hand courner the bar will follow the mouse.
If you glide your mouse over the triangle in the right hand side of the dash board 
the space unicorn will appear to play its theam tune for you when you click the button 
but like a siren at sea you cant stop the unicorn once it starts.
There are four buttons around the triangle if you click the one to the left of the 
triangle a transparent monitor will display this too has a slider that will follow your 
mouse.
If you click the mouse right of the triangel a tracker radar will appear the triangel will point
out your enemies.
and if you really dont like your enemies you can shoot them with your rainbow bullets
curticy of the space unicorn by pressing the top button.
The final button beneath the triangle ends the programme.

I started the assignment the day we got it so the code is far messier than had I started later
knowing the language better now than I had then. Alot of the assinment consisted of trial and 
error and there are alot of features I would love to add and improve but I have no idea how to do
so with out getting errors from the code and I have just gotten to the stage where I am terrified
of breaking it to the point that it wont work anymore. Alot of it is hard coded so to change the frame
size could quite possibly mess up the entire programme which is why from the beinning I coded it using
a 1000 by 1000 sized screen hoping to make it large enough to satisfy. As it is a build up since September
it comprises of elements some slightly modified some not so much that we made in class. The features I am
most proud of are the monitor, the radar, and the music button as I find these were the elements 
that turned out exactaly as I had wanted them to.
